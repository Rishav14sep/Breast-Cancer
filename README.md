# Breast-Cancer
The goal is to classify whether the breast cancer is benign or malignant. To achieve this we have used machine learning classification methods to fit a function that can predict the discrete class of new input.
ÔÅ¨Using Machine Learning In this project various parameters of  Breast Cancer was given and we have develop a solution that is  capable of predicting the Braest Cancer  better than  individuals. We have used linear regression algorithm,Knn,decision tree ,random forest and python libraries Scikit-learn and Pandas
